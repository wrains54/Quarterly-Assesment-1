The repository contains three Python files: Create, Add, and Read. Users should interact with the Add file to run the quiz bowl application. The Add file serves as the main script to launch and operate the quiz.

The Read file is designated for reviewing the questions and answers stored within each table of the database. The Create file was utilized to establish the database, including its five tables, and to populate them with the initial set of questions and answers. Within the Create file, you'll find commented-out sample code demonstrating how to insert new entries and how to remove existing ones.
